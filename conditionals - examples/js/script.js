//Conditional Logic - with an Expression


var kidHeight = 40;
var minHeight = 48;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride"
//if the kid is over 48 inches in height
//kidHeight + 2 would be if his shoes add 2 inches
if(kidHeight + 2 > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
